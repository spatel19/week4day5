# Warmup exercise: cryptogram
## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Background

Encryption is a powerful tool which has been used for centuries to protect
inormation. The sender of a piece of information scrambles it so that only the
holder of a key can decrypt and access the information.

A cryptogram is a simple puzzle that involves decoding a message encrypted using
something called a [substitution
cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher), where each letter is
swapped for another letter or a number.
