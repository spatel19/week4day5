// INLINE EXERCISE: Password hashing
//
// Write a hash function below that takes an input string and returns an
// output hash (as a string). The function should:
// 1. Be fast to run
// 2. Produce as few collisions as possible
//
// We've filled in a very simple, naive (and pretty bad) hash function for you
// as a starting point.

function hashIt(word) {
  // This hash function returns a string, and it's fast, but it's pretty
  // crummy since it produces tons of collisions!
  return word.length.toString();
}
